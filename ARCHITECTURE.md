## Communication Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend to design synthetic biology circuits.
2. **API Requests**: The frontend sends requests to the API Gateway.
3. **Service Routing**: The API Gateway routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
4. **Data Processing**: Microservices process the requests and return results.
5. **Response Aggregation**: The API Gateway aggregates responses and returns them to the frontend.
6. **Visualization**: The frontend visualizes the results for the user.

## Data Flow

1. **Design Creation**: Users create designs in the DNA Designer.
2. **Validation**: Designs are validated by the AI Service.
3. **Simulation**: Validated designs are simulated by the Simulation Engine.
4. **Safety Analysis**: Designs are analyzed for safety concerns.
5. **IP Protection**: Designs can be minted as IP-NFTs on the blockchain.
6. **Storage**: Designs are stored in the database with references to external data sources.

## Deployment Architecture

BioForge can be deployed in various environments:

1. **Development**: Docker Compose for local development
   - Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` for development environment
   - Use `docker-compose.yml` for production environment
2. **Testing**: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
   - Workflow files located in `.github/workflows/`
3. **Production**: Kubernetes cluster for scalability and reliability

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication for user authentication
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for API endpoints
3. **Data Encryption**: HTTPS for all communications
