## Introduction

BioForge is a comprehensive no-code synthetic biology platform that empowers scientists, students, and citizen scientists to design, simulate, and share synthetic organisms. Our mission is to democratize synthetic biology and accelerate innovation in addressing global sustainability challenges.

## Getting Started

### Creating an Account

1. Visit [bioforge.org](https://bioforge.org) and click "Sign Up"
2. Enter your email address and create a password
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your profile

### Navigating the Interface

The BioForge interface consists of several key sections:

- **Home**: Dashboard with your recent designs and community highlights
- **Designer**: The DNA circuit designer interface
- **Explore**: Browse community designs and parts
- **Learn**: Educational resources and tutorials
- **Community**: Forums and collaboration tools
- **Profile**: Your account settings and designs

## DNA Designer

The DNA Designer is the core tool of BioForge, allowing you to create synthetic biology designs using a drag-and-drop interface.

### Parts Palette

The Parts Palette contains various genetic parts categorized by function:

- **Promoters**: Control gene expression
- **Genes**: Code for proteins
- **Terminators**: End transcription
- **RBS**: Ribosome binding sites for translation
- **Operators**: Regulatory elements

### Creating a Design

1. Drag parts from the palette to the canvas
2. Arrange parts in the correct order (typically: promoter → RBS → gene → terminator)
3. Click on parts to view and edit their properties
4. Save your design with a name and description

### Importing and Exporting

- **Import**: Upload designs in GenBank or SBOL format
- **Export**: Download designs in various formats (GenBank, SBOL, FASTA)

## Simulation

BioForge allows you to simulate your designs to predict their behavior before implementation in the lab.

### Running a Simulation

1. Create or open a design
2. Click the "Run Simulation" button
3. Configure simulation parameters (environment, host organism, etc.)
4. View the simulation results

### Interpreting Results

Simulation results include:

- **Growth Rate**: Predicted growth of the host organism
- **Protein Expression**: Level of protein production
- **Metabolic Burden**: Impact on the host's metabolism
- **Stability**: Genetic stability of the design
- **Time Series Data**: Changes in key metrics over time

## Safety Checks

BioForge includes built-in safety checks to ensure responsible synthetic biology.

### Running Safety Checks

1. Create or open a design
2. Click the "Safety Check" button
3. Review the safety analysis

### Safety Metrics

Safety analysis includes:

- **Overall Safety Score**: General safety assessment
- **Toxicity Risk**: Potential toxic effects
- **Environmental Risk**: Potential environmental impact
- **Biocontainment**: Effectiveness of containment strategies
- **Recommendations**: Suggestions for improving safety

## Blockchain & IP-NFTs

BioForge allows you to secure your intellectual property using blockchain technology.

### Connecting Your Wallet

1. Go to the Blockchain page
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Follow the instructions to connect your Ethereum/Polygon wallet

### Minting an IP-NFT

1. Open a design you want to protect
2. Click "Mint IP-NFT"
3. Configure royalty distribution if collaborating
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
5. View your IP-NFT in the "My Tokens" section

## Community & Sharing

BioForge is built around a collaborative community of synthetic biologists.

### Sharing Designs

1. Open a design you want to share
2. Click "Share"
3. Choose sharing options (public, private, specific users)
4. Add a description and tags

### Collaborating

1. Open a design
2. Click "Collaborators"
3. Add collaborators by email or username
4. Set permission levels (view, edit, admin)

### Forums and Discussions

1. Go to the Community section
2. Browse or create topics
3. Participate in discussions
4. Share knowledge and ask questions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Design Not Saving**: Ensure you're logged in and have a stable internet connection
- **Simulation Errors**: Check that your design has all necessary components
- **Wallet Connection Issues**: Make sure you're using a supported wallet and browser

### Getting Help
