## Introduction

Synthetic biology has the potential to solve global challenges, but it also comes with responsibilities. BioForge is committed to promoting safe and responsible synthetic biology practices. These guidelines are designed to help users understand and mitigate potential risks associated with their designs.

## Responsible Innovation

### Principles of Responsible Innovation

1. **Anticipate** potential implications and risks
2. **Reflect** on purposes, motivations, and potential impacts
3. **Engage** with experts and stakeholders
4. **Act** to influence the direction and trajectory of the innovation

### Dual-Use Research of Concern

Dual-use research of concern (DURC) refers to life sciences research that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat to public health and safety, agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, or national security.

BioForge automatically flags designs that may constitute DURC and requires additional safety measures and review for such designs.

## Biosafety Levels

Biosafety levels (BSL) are designations applied to laboratories based on the organisms they work with and the containment precautions required.

### BSL-1

- Suitable for work with well-characterized agents not known to cause disease in healthy adults
- Standard microbiological practices
- Open bench work
- No special containment equipment required

### BSL-2

- Suitable for work with agents of moderate potential hazard to personnel and the environment
- BSL-1 practices plus limited access, biohazard warning signs, sharps precautions
- Class I or II Biological Safety Cabinets (BSCs) for procedures that may cause splashes or aerosols

### BSL-3

- Suitable for work with indigenous or exotic agents with potential for respiratory transmission
- BSL-2 practices plus controlled access, decontamination of all waste, laboratory clothing decontamination
- Class I or II BSCs for all manipulations

### BSL-4

- Suitable for work with dangerous and exotic agents with high risk of life-threatening disease
- BSL-3 practices plus airlock entry, shower exit, special waste disposal
- All work conducted in Class III BSCs or full-body, air-supplied positive-pressure suits

BioForge will indicate the recommended biosafety level for your design based on its components and characteristics.

## Biocontainment Strategies

Biocontainment strategies are essential for preventing the unintended release of engineered organisms into the environment.

### Physical Containment

- Use appropriate biosafety level facilities
- Implement proper waste disposal procedures
- Follow standard operating procedures for handling biological materials

### Genetic Containment

BioForge recommends and can help implement several genetic containment strategies:

1. **Auxotrophy**: Engineer organisms to require nutrients not available in the environment
2. **Kill Switches**: Genetic circuits that cause cell death under specific conditions
3. **Semantic Containment**: Genetic recoding to prevent horizontal gene transfer
4. **Orthogonal Systems**: Using non-standard amino acids or nucleotides

### Recommended Practices

- Always include at least one biocontainment mechanism in your designs
- Consider using multiple, redundant containment strategies
- Test the effectiveness of containment mechanisms before implementation

## Regulatory Compliance

Synthetic biology is subject to various regulations depending on your location and the nature of your work.

### International Frameworks

- **Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety**: International agreement on the safe handling, transport, and use of living modified organisms
- **Biological Weapons Convention**: Prohibition of biological weapons development, production, and stockpiling

### United States Regulations

- **NIH Guidelines**: Guidelines for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules
- **Select Agent Regulations**: Controls on possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins
- **EPA Regulations**: Regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act for new microorganisms

### European Union Regulations

- **Directive 2009/41/EC**: Contained use of genetically modified microorganisms
- **Directive 2001/18/EC**: Deliberate release of GMOs into the environment

BioForge will flag designs that may require regulatory approval and provide guidance on compliance.

## Ethical Considerations

### Responsible Design

- Consider the potential environmental impact of your designs
- Evaluate potential unintended consequences
- Design with safety as a primary consideration

### Transparency

- Document your design decisions and safety measures
- Share safety data and protocols with the community
- Be open about potential risks and limitations

### Inclusivity

- Consider how your work might affect different communities
- Engage with diverse stakeholders
- Respect cultural and regional perspectives on biotechnology

## Community Standards

BioForge community standards for safety:

1. **Do No Harm**: Designs should not be intended to cause harm to humans, animals, or the environment
2. **Safety First**: Prioritize safety in all design decisions
3. **Transparency**: Be open about potential risks and safety measures
4. **Responsibility**: Take responsibility for the potential impacts of your designs
5. **Continuous Learning**: Stay informed about safety best practices and emerging concerns

## Reporting Concerns

If you have safety concerns about a design on BioForge:

1. Use the "Report Concern" button on the design page
2. Provide specific details about your concern
3. The BioForge safety team will review the report and take appropriate action

For urgent safety concerns, contact safety@bioforge.org directly.
